Right now there project exists with a mix of new and old (old) code, some of which is adopted from other languages!

  
Features
--------

The idea behind kacTalk is to simplify API access.
kacTalk is designed with ideas like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS.

kacTalk is all about generalizing the usage of APIs and general communication
between server and client.  

Paired with the API is a scripting language.
